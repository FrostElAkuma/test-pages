            <h2>Method 1: From Opulant Chests</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Drang (BAROQUE) can drop randomly from opening Opulant chests in the Leviathan among other Opulant weapons.<br>
                The Incandecent Roll is rng but opening more chests increases the chance of you getting one.<br>
                In order to open an opulent chest you need an opulent key which can drop randoomly from opening chests all around the leviathan.<br>
                Best method to farm keys is roaming inside the royal gardens killing enemies and opening chests whenever one spawns.<br>
                Another good method is doing nightmare containments which you can open 3 chests at the end (the default chest on completion and 2 around the area)

            <h2>Method 2: Focusing Opulent weapons</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                You can get focus Opulant weapons in the H.E.L.M and get the Drang (BAROQUE) <br>
                Again the Incandicent Roll is rng but you can directly focus a Drang (BAROQUE) instead of opening a chests and getting it randomly among other Opulant weapons.<br>
                You will need to upgrade the crown of sorrow and unlock the ability to focus Opulant weapons first. <br>
                You will also need some Opulant Umbral Energy and an Opulant engram in order to focus an opulant weapon

            <h2>Method 3: Die</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some times rng won't give you the Drang (BAROQUE) with the desired roll. I got mine after 14 failed Drangs. :)))
